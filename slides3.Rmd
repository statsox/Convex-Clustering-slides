## My story with <span style="color: orange">`R` in USA</span> 

> * `R` skill brought me to work in USA in Biostatistics Departments<br /><br /> 
> * <span style="color: orange">Top #1 tool</span> used in academic Biostatsistics<br /><br />
> * <span style="color: orange">Reproducibility & usability awareness</span> - rarely one can see a methodology paper published without corresponding `R` package<br /><br /> 



#  <span style="color: orange">Clustering</span> 

## Cluster analysis -  <span style="color: orange">goals</span>   

<br />

> * We perform clustering when we want to <span style="color: orange">group or segment the data set</span> into subsets so that objects within each subset are more closely related to others than those objects assigned to other subsets. 


## Motivation: <span style="color: orange">cancer subtype discovery</span> 

> * A cancer may present clinically as a homogenous disease, but it typically consists of several distinct <span style="color: orange">subtypes at the molecular level</span><br /><br />

> * One of cancer research goals is to identify such cancer subtypes - groups of patients that share <span style="color: orange">distinct genomic signatures and cancer-differing clinical outcomes</span><br /><br />

> * It is the first step towards developing personalized treatment strategies (example: see MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) [Personalized Cancer Therapy webpage](https://pct.mdanderson.org/#/) based on Molecular Profiling)



## Cancer subtype discovery as a <span style="color: orange">biclustering</span> problem 

> * We look for subtypes of cancerous tumors that have similar molecular profiles and the genes that characterize each of the them<br /><br />
> * This subtype discovery problem can be posed as a <span style="color: orange">biclustering problem of gene expression
data</span> matrix, where data is partitioned into a checkerboard-like pattern

## Cancer subtype discovery as a <span style="color: orange">biclustering</span> problem - <span style="color: orange">successess and failures</span>

> * Biclustering breast cancer data has identified sets of genes whose expression levels segregated patients into
five subtypes with distinct survival outcomes (Sørlie et al., 2001)<br /><br />
> * These subtypes have been reproduced in numerous other studies (Sørlie et al., 2003)<br /><br />
> * ... but some other subtypes discoveries were not (i.e. with ovarian cancer (Tothill et al., 2008))


## Cancer subtype discovery as a <span style="color: orange">biclustering</span> problem - <span style="color: orange">challenges</span>

> * The failure to reproduce these other results may reflect an absence of biologically meaningful
groupings<br /><br />
> * ... but another possibility may be related to <span style="color: orange">limitations in the computational
methods currently used</span> to identify biclusters<br /><br />

> * **Goal**: Discover clinically <span style="color: orange">meaningful & reproducible</span> cancer subtypes


# Simple solution: <span style="color: orange">bicluster heatmap</span> with `hclust`

## Simple solution: <span style="color: orange">bicluster heatmap</span> with `hclust`

```{r setup, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", include = FALSE}
# Load all libraries actually here so as to hide packages loading  messages 
library(knitr)
library(s4vd)
library(cvxbiclustr)

opts_knit$set(upload.fun = function(file) imgur_upload(file))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, results = "hide", fig.height=3.5}
library(s4vd)
data(lung200) # lung cancer data set (Bhattacharjee et al. 2001)

lung200.D.mat <- dist(lung200, method = "euclidean") 
lung200.hclust <- hclust(t(lung200.D.mat), method = "average")

heatmap(lung200, Rowv = as.dendrogram(lung200.hclust), cexRow = 0.3, cexCol = 0.7)
```
