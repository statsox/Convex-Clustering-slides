## My story with <span style="color: orange">`R` in USA</span> 

> * `R` skill brought me to work in USA in Biostatistics Departments<br /><br /> 
> * <span style="color: orange">Top #1 tool</span> used in academic Biostatsistics<br /><br />
> * <span style="color: orange">Reproducibility & usability awareness</span> - rarely one can see a methodology paper published without corresponding `R` package<br /><br /> 



#  <span style="color: orange">Clustering</span> 

## Cluster analysis -  <span style="color: orange">goals</span>   

<br />

> * We perform clustering when we want to <span style="color: orange">group or segment the data set</span> into subsets so that objects within each subset are more closely related to others than those objects assigned to other subsets. 


## Motivation: <span style="color: orange">cancer subtype discovery</span> 

> * A cancer may present clinically as a homogenous disease, but it typically consists of several distinct <span style="color: orange">subtypes at the molecular level</span><br /><br />

> * One of cancer research goals is to identify such cancer subtypes - groups of patients that share <span style="color: orange">distinct genomic signatures and cancer-differing clinical outcomes</span><br /><br />

> * It is the first step towards developing personalized treatment strategies (example: see MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) [Personalized Cancer Therapy webpage](https://pct.mdanderson.org/#/) based on Molecular Profiling)



## Cancer subtype discovery as a <span style="color: orange">biclustering</span> problem 

> * We look for subtypes of cancerous tumors that have similar molecular profiles and the genes that characterize each of the them<br /><br />
> * This subtype discovery problem can be posed as a <span style="color: orange">biclustering problem of gene expression
data</span> matrix, where data is partitioned into a checkerboard-like pattern
